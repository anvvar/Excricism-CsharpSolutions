## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a platform designed to help you improve your programming skills through practice and mentorship. It offers a variety of language tracks, including C#, where you can solve coding exercises and receive feedback from mentors to enhance your understanding and proficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Exercism C# learning track, you will need to:

1. Sign up for an account on the [Exercism website](https://exercism.io/).
2. Install the [Exercism CLI](https://exercism.io/cli) to download and submit exercises locally.
3. Choose the C# learning track and start working on the exercises.

Each exercise comes with a description, some example test cases, and a set of implementation guidelines. You need to write your solutions in C# to pass the provided tests. The goal is to solve the exercise using the most idiomatic and efficient approach.

## Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the Exercism C# learning track. The solutions are organized in directories corresponding to each exercise. Inside each directory, you will find the exercise description, the test suite, and my solution code.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and compare them with your own. However, it's important to remember that the learning process is about understanding the concepts and solving problems on your own. So, don't rely solely on these solutions but use them as a reference when you need guidance or want to validate your approach.

## Contributing

As these solutions are personal work, I'm not accepting contributions to this repository. However, if you find any bugs or improvements in my solutions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me directly. I appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions you may have.
